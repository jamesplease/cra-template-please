# cra-template-please

My personal template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

> This assumes I have already [configured my computer](configuring-your-computer).

To scaffold an app, use:

```
cra {name_of_app}
```

To create an app in the current directory, use:

```
cra .
```

### New App Checklist

When building an application, there are a couple of things I need to do after installing the template.

- [ ] Search for the string `~~TEMPLATE~~` and change those values.
- [ ] Add a favicon. I typically use [this app](https://realfavicongenerator.net).

## Configuring My Computer

Create an alias for `cra`:

```
alias cra="npx create-react-app --template cra-template-please"
```

## Developing

I can test changes to this template without publishing using this command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template file:./cra-template-please
```

### Notes

- Everything is a `dependency` in `template.json` because Create React App templates do not support
  `devDependencies` as of July 2020.
